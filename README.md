# **README: Fine-Tuning and Evaluating T5 Models for Scientific Question Answering with Dense Passage Retrieval on A100 GPU**

## **Project Overview**
This project evaluates and tests several **custom fine-tuned transformer models** for question answering. The models tested include **T5-base**, **T5-base with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)**, **DeBERTa-based T5**, and **T5-large**, all of which were **fine-tuned by the user**. The fine-tuning was performed using domain-specific datasets to enhance the models' ability to answer science-related questions. The **Google Colab environment** with the **A100 GPU** was used for running the models efficiently.
The following models are available for download:

- **T5-large** (Fine-tuned model): [Download T5-large](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tm3VdeWladzpXSRT6bdMQ474kEIzm7rA/view?usp=drive_link)

## **1. Setup and Requirements**

### **1.1. Google Colab Setup**

1. Open your **Google Colab** notebook.
2. Go to the menu at the top: `Runtime > Change runtime type`.
3. Under **Hardware accelerator**, select **GPU**.
4. In the **GPU type** dropdown, select **NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB** (if available). This ensures that you are using the **A100 GPU** for the task.

### **1.2. Installing Required Libraries**

The following libraries are necessary for running the fine-tuned models:

```bash
!pip install --quiet transformers faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
```

These libraries include:
- **Transformers**: For loading and running pre-trained and fine-tuned models like **T5**.
- **FAISS**: For fast similarity search (optional for context retrieval with **DPR**).
- **Sentence-transformers**: For tokenization and embeddings if required.

### **1.3. Check GPU Availability**

The following Python code will verify that the **A100 GPU** is being used and will help you ensure that your environment is set up correctly:

```python
# Check if we are using the A100 GPU
import torch

# Check if CUDA (GPU) is available and which device is being used
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
gpu_name = torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if device == "cuda" else "No GPU"
print(f"Using device: {device} ({gpu_name})")

# Ensure that the runtime is using the A100 GPU (required for the test)
if gpu_name != "NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB":
    print("Warning: You are not using the A100 GPU. Please make sure to select A100 in Colab's runtime settings.")
else:
    print("Confirmed: Using NVIDIA A100 GPU.")
```

### **1.4. Verifying Installation**

After installing the required libraries, you can run a test to verify that everything is working properly. The following code loads a **T5 model** (you can replace it with your custom fine-tuned model) and generates an answer to a sample question.

```python
import faiss
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load T5 model and tokenizer (replace with your fine-tuned model path)
model_name = "t5-large"  # Replace with your fine-tuned model path if needed
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name).to(device)
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Test the model with a sample question
test_question = "What is the speed of light?"

# Encode input
input_ids = tokenizer(test_question, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(device)

# Generate answer using T5
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model.generate(input_ids)

# Decode the answer
answer = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Question: {test_question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

## **2. Fine-Tuned Models**

### **2.1. Model Overview**

The following models were fine-tuned by the user:

- **T5-base** (fine-tuned for question answering)
- **T5-base with DPR** (using Dense Passage Retrieval for context retrieval)
- **DeBERTa-based T5** (fine-tuned for improved understanding and generation)
- **T5-large** (fine-tuned for improved accuracy and generalization)

The fine-tuning was performed on a domain-specific dataset to help the models generate accurate answers for questions in the science domain.

### **2.2. Testing and Performance Evaluation**

The models were evaluated on the following questions:

1. **What is the speed of light?**
2. **Why is the sky blue?**
3. **Explain Newton's first law of motion.**

#### **Test Results**

| **Question**                                | **T5-base (Fine-Tuned)** | **T5-base with DPR** | **DeBERTa-based T5** | **T5-large** |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **What is the speed of light?**            | Incomplete (f/cm)        | Incomplete (m/s)     | Incorrect (The variable) | Correct (299,792,458 meters per second) |
| **Why is the sky blue?**                   | Incorrect (it blocks sunlight) | Incorrect (it shines) | Empty (`<s>`)        | Correct (Rayleigh scattering of sunlight) |
| **Explain Newton's first law of motion.**  | Incomplete (foundation of dynamics) | Incorrect (The variable) | Empty (`<s>`)        | Correct (Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless) |

## **3. Key Insights and Observations**

### **3.1. Performance Evaluation**

- **T5-base** and **DeBERTa-based T5** performed poorly, generating incomplete or incorrect answers. **T5-large**, however, generated accurate and complete answers for the majority of the test cases.
- **T5-base with DPR** showed improvement with context retrieval, but the model still produced incomplete or vague answers, suggesting that **context retrieval** alone isn't sufficient for accurate answer generation.

### **3.2. Impact of Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)**

- The **DPR mechanism** significantly helped the model access external knowledge but did not fully resolve the challenges with answer generation. Although **T5-base with DPR** retrieved relevant context, it was not able to integrate that context into a coherent and factually accurate answer.

### **3.3. The Best Model: T5-Large**

- **T5-Large** outperformed all other models, generating the most accurate and complete answers. While there were some **incomplete answers** (for Newtonâ€™s first law), this model showed the best overall performance, especially in terms of **factual accuracy**.

---

## **4. Recommendations for Future Work**

### **4.1. Further Fine-Tuning**

- The **T5-base** and **DeBERTa-based T5** models should undergo further fine-tuning on **more domain-specific datasets** to improve their ability to generate accurate and relevant answers. Fine-tuning on a variety of **scientific question-answer pairs** would help these models better handle complex questions.

### **4.2. Improved Contextual Retrieval**

- While **DPR** helped retrieve useful context, the fine-tuning of **retrieval models** and corpus expansion is recommended to improve performance. A more focused and relevant **document corpus** should be used for fine-tuning **retrievers**.

### **4.3. Post-Processing and Answer Refinement**

- Implementing **post-processing steps** such as **fact-checking** and **answer refinement** would significantly improve the output of the models, especially for incomplete answers generated by models like **T5-Large**.

---

## **5. Conclusion**

In this project, the fine-tuned **T5** models, including those using **DPR for context retrieval**, were evaluated for their ability to answer science-related questions. The **T5-large** model performed the best overall, generating accurate and complete answers for most questions. Despite the improvements from **DPR**, further fine-tuning and better integration of context are needed to enhance the model's ability to generate fully grounded and complete answers.

Ensure that the runtime is configured to use the **A100 GPU** and that the necessary libraries are installed. You can then run the code provided in this README to verify that your models are working correctly.
